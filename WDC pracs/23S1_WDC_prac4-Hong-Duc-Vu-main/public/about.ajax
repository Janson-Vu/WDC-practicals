<p>AJAX is awesome because it allows us to load page content in the background.
Server routes for AJAX requests are no different than other routes.
AJAX response data can be any format.
AJAX allows us to send HTTP requests using JavaScript.
AJAX HTTP requests and non AJAX HTTP requests are treated equally by the server.
